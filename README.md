I'm a Media Support Specialist from Italy, currently living in London and working for the BBC.
 
My  career began with Digital Video Editing.
I studied Arts, Music, Theatre and Film
for 5 years between Turin and Bologna.
 
Because learning is a continuum I later on achieved
a Master in Digital Media in London.
 
I have fifteen years experience in Video  Production and my focus now is on editing, interactive media and coding.
 
I'm passionate about building compelling stories  using creativity and a mix of video production, coding
and web design.
